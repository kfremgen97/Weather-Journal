# Weather Journal

### Udacity's Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Project

An asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI for a Weather-Journal App.
This project uses an express server to create a local back end for handling data from the client side.

#### Getting project running

To run the server side of the project, you will need node js installed and the following packages listed below.
From the root project type the command **node server/src/app.js**

To run the client side of the project, a server is needed such as live-server. The client side entry point is **client/src/index.html**.
- If using vscode, the live server extension will work fine. Navigate to the client entry point as stated above and then click the go live button at the bottom of the vscode window.

Packages used on server side:
- express
- body-parser
- cors
- uuid
- eslint

Packages used on client side:
